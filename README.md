Text detection with MLKit and google translation API to translate the detected text.<br><br>
This app detects the text from a picture input using camera or photos gallery of the iPhone/Simulator. The app uses on device <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/ml-kit/ios/recognize-text"> Text Recognition </a> in iOS using <a href = "https://firebase.google.com/docs/ml-kit/"> MLKit </a> in <a href = "https://firebase.google.com/"> Firebase </a> by Google and then translates the detected text in chosen language using <a href = "https://cloud.google.com/translate/"> Google Cloud Translate API</a>.



You would need to add GoogleService-Info.plist file to your project for firebase integration in order to use MLKit. You will have to login to your gmail account for accessing the console to firebase.
